# Online-Tracker-for-Amazon-products
Track your products online using python and find the price drop of your favorite products.


Use this python script to track the price of a particular product and get notified via email.

Note:

I have used amazon product in this script. You can choose your own site of your choice but make sure it accepts web scraping.

In order to send a mail you must activate gmail 2 step verification. Then search for 'google app password'.
Enter the link using your id --> Select the app as 'Mail' --> Select device as 'Windows computer' (for windows ans MAC for mac)
Copy the password and use it in your script.


After executing the script when the price of that paticular product drops below your expected price you will recieve an email.
